# ChatGPT‑like Chatbot Website: Feature Checklist

LampChat GPT

## Core Chat Experience

- Natural, streaming responses (token-by-token typing effect)
- Rich text formatting (headings, bullets, code blocks with syntax highlighting, tables, math via LaTeX)
- Inline citations and clickable hyperlinks
- Follow-up suggestions and quick-reply chips
- Message editing and “regenerate response”
- Conversation memory within a session and selective recall across sessions
- Multi-turn context handling with system/user/assistant role separation
- Prompt templates and saved prompts

## Multimodal I/O

- Image uploads (PNG/JPG/WebP/GIF) with OCR and vision analysis
- File uploads (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, XLSX, PPTX, JSON, ZIP) with page/section extraction
- Audio input (mic capture) and ASR transcription
- Text-to-speech playback with selectable voices, speed, and downloadable audio
- Image generation and image editing (inpainting/outpainting) with safety filters
- Code execution or sandboxes for runnable snippets (optional)

## Conversations & Organization

- New chat, rename chat, pin/favorite
- Folders/collections and tags
- Global search across all chats and files
- Shareable links with redaction and permissions (view/comment/duplicate)
- Export conversations (JSON/HTML/Markdown/PDF)
- Import prompts or chats

## Prompting & Tools

- System prompt configuration per chat
- Tool use
- Function calling schema and tool result rendering
- Tool usage visibility and logs for transparency
- Retries and fallbacks across models/tools

## Knowledge & Retrieval (RAG)

- Private knowledge base ingestion (files, URLs, connectors) in projects.
- Chunking, embeddings, vector store, metadata filters
- Source citation with page spans/snippets
- Periodic reindexing and versioning
- Access controls on corpora (org/team/user level)

## Models & Routing

- Multiple model support (GPT, open-source, vision, TTS/ASR)
- Model selector per conversation/message
- Automatic model routing by task type/size/cost
- Temperature, max tokens, top‑p, penalties
- Safe failover and timeouts; retry with backoff

## UX & Accessibility

- Keyboard-first UX (enter to send, shift+enter newline, shortcuts)
- Mobile-responsive layout and PWA support
- Light/dark themes; font size controls
- ARIA roles, focus states, screen reader support
- High-contrast mode and reduced motion
- Loading, error, and empty states that are clear and helpful

## Safety & Compliance

- Prompt injection and data exfiltration protections
- Audit logs of model/tool usage
- Data residency and retention policies

## Collaboration & Team

- Multi-user workspaces, roles/permissions (admin/editor/viewer)
- Shared folders, shared prompts, team templates
- Commenting/notes on messages
- Usage analytics by user/team/project
- Quotas/credits and cost visibility

## Developer & Extensibility

- Plugin/tool SDK (define function schemas, auth, UI rendering of results)
- Webhooks and events (message.created, tool.invoked, file.uploaded)
- REST and WebSocket APIs for send/stream
- Server-sent events (SSE) for streaming
- Custom UI components for tool results (charts/tables)
- Environment configuration per workspace (API keys, secrets vault)

## Files & Data Handling

- Secure file storage with virus scanning and MIME validation
- File size/type limits with clear messaging
- OCR and document parsing (PDF tables, slides, docs)
- Temporary vs persistent storage lifecycles
- Chunked uploads with resumability

## Observability & Quality

- Tracing (prompt, response, tokens, latency) per turn
- Prompt/response diffing and regression tests
- Feedback mechanisms (thumbs up/down, reasons, flags)
- Real-time metrics dashboard (latency, error rates, costs)

## Performance & Reliability

- Horizontal scaling of stateless chat workers
- Caching (responses, embeddings, tool results)
- Rate limiting and circuit breakers
- Queueing for long-running tool calls
- Graceful degradation when tools or models fail

## Authentication & Billing

- OAuth/SAML/SSO and 2FA
- Org and project workspaces; tenant isolation
- API keys and per-key scopes/quotas
- Billing: metering by tokens, calls, storage, seats
- Invoicing and usage exports

## Frontend Components

- Chat transcript with virtualized list
- Message composer with toolbar (upload, voice, formatting)
- Side panel for files, tools, references, and settings
- Token/word counters and cost estimates
- Command palette (/) for tools and templates

## Internationalization

- UI localization; multilingual input/output
- Right-to-left layout support
- Locale-aware formatting (dates, numbers, currencies)
